TwilioIVRVoicemail
==================

Twilio Based IVR that includes whisper and voicemail services. 

This code was setup to provide small business's with the ability to handle and manage a small business IVR. 
The initial code is setup with two options, Sales and Support. 

On page: twilioIncomingCallHander.php you need to add the phone numbers you want to be called when the user chooses the Sales or Support option. 

On page: handleRecording.php you will need to put in your email details such as where you want the voicemail to be emailed. 

This code is provided without a warranty, you are free to make modifications as you see fit. 

Changes I Hope to make:
A better voicemail email, that looks nicer cosmetically.
